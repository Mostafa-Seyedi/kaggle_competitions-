# Kaggle Machine Learning Collection 🏆

This repository contains my solutions and experiments for various Kaggle competitions. The projects are organized by task type, focusing on end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines—from raw data to final predictions.

## 📂 Repository Structure

I've organized my work into categories based on the nature of the problem:

* **/Classification**: Projects involving binary or multi-class targets (e.g., Titanic, Heart Disease, Fraud Detection).
* **/Regression**: Projects focused on predicting continuous values (e.g., House Prices, Sales Forecasting).
* **/Computer-Vision**: Image classification and object detection tasks.
* **/NLP**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, and NER.

## 📈 Methodology

For every competition, I follow a systematic approach:
1. **EDA:** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and missing data.
2. **Preprocessing:** Handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to capture underlying patterns. (Sometimes)
4. **Modeling:** Training baseline models and moving toward complex ensembles.
5. **Evaluation:** Tuning models based on competition-specific metrics (LogLoss, RMSE, etc.).
